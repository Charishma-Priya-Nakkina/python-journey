Hello world.py file is about the basic Hello world program and differnt prompts for print.
<br>
<br>
<h4>NOTE :</h4>
<br>
Syntax error will occur  
<br>
   1.If the closing commas are not present.
<br>
   2.If print "Hello World" is given without parenthesis.
<br>
   3.If we use single commas for print('print('Welcome')') rather we can write this in two ways:
<br>
       * print('print("Welcome")') #output : print("Welcome")
<br>
       * print("print('Welcome')") #output : print('Welcome')
<br>
<br>
Indentation is must and should in python.
<br>
Hashtag(#) is used for single line comment.
<br>
Syntax for Input function : input(prompt) #prompt is optional
<br>
By default input function is string(data type)
<br>
<h4>Variables</h4> are the containers that stores values , no need to declare before its use.
<br>
We can change the values of the variables , it always takes the recently stored value.
<br>
Type Error occurs if we concatenate integer and string.
<br>
<h4>VARIABLE NAMING RULES : </h4>
<br>
1. It can only have A-Z , a-z ,0-9 and underscore
<br>
2. Space is not allowed
<br>
3. Variable name shouldn't start with number
<br>
4. We can't use reserved word
<br>
5. Python is case sensitive
<br>
<br>
We don't need to mention the type of data while initializing a variale.
<br>
We can directly print "\" this symbol,to print this we use, print("//").
<br>
len function is used to find the length of strings only.
<br>
Changing one data type in to another data type is TYPE CASTING or TYPE CONVERSION.
<br>
In 3.X version the result is a float; ex: print(4/2) gives the value of 2.0
