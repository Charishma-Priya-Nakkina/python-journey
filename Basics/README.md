Hello world.py file is about the basic Hello world program and differnt prompts for print.
<br>
<br>
<h4>NOTE :</h4>
Syntax error will occur  
<br>
   1.If the closing commas are not present.
<br>
   2.If print "Hello World" is given without parenthesis.
<br>
   3.If we use single commas for print('print('Welcome')') rather we can write this in two ways:
<br>
       * print('print("Welcome")') #output : print("Welcome")
<br>
       * print("print('Welcome')") #output : print('Welcome')
<br>
<br>
Indentation is must and should in python.
<br>
Hashtag(#) is used for single line comment.
<br>
Inline comment : comments can also be placed at the end of the line
<br>
print("HI") # any comment , output: HI 
<br>
Multi-line comment: we can use hashtag in every line or we can use triple quotes(""" or ''')
<br>
<br>
Syntax for Input function : input(prompt) ;prompt is optional
<br>
By default input function is string(data type)
<br>
<h4>Variables</h4> are the containers that stores values , no need to declare before its use.
<br>
We can change the values of the variables , it always takes the recently stored value.
<br>
Data types tells python what kind of data you're storing
<br>
INTEGER : Whole Numbers
<br>
FLOAT : Numbers with decimal points
<br>
STRING : Text
<br>
BOOLEAN : True or False
<br>
<br>
Type Error occurs if we concatenate integer and string.
<br>
<h4>VARIABLE NAMING RULES : </h4>
<br>
1. It can only have A-Z , a-z ,0-9 and underscore
<br>
2. Space is not allowed
<br>
3. Variable name shouldn't start with number
<br>
4. We can't use reserved word
<br>
5. Python is case sensitive
<br>
<br>
We don't need to mention the type of data while initializing a variale.
<br>
We can directly print "\" this symbol,to print this we use, print("//").
<br>
len function is used to find the length of strings only.
<br>
Changing one data type in to another data type is TYPE CASTING or TYPE CONVERSION.
<br>
In 3.X version the result is a float; ex: print(4/2) gives the value of 2.0
<h4>Operators</h4>
Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables.
<br>
1.  Arithmetic Operators : These operators perform mathematical operations like addition,subtraction etc..
<br>
Addition (+) , Subtraction (-) , Multiplication (*) , Division (/) , Modulus:Remainder of division (%) , Floor division:Returns the integer part of the division (//) , Exponentation (**)
<br>
EX: a=10 , b=5
<br>
    print(a+b) #output=15
    <br>
    print(a-b) #output=5
    <br>
    <br>
2.  Comparision Operators : These operators compare two values and return True or False
<br>
Equal to (==) , Not equal to (!=) , Greater than (>) , Less than (<) , Greater than or equal to (>=) , Less than or equal to (<=)
<br>
   <br>
3.  Logical Operators : These operators are used to combine conditional statements
<br>
and : Returns True if both conditions are true
<br>
or : Returns True if at least one condition is true
<br>
not : Reverses the result ( returns true if condition is false)
